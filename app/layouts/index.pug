          h1(class='red text-center') The story behind Meetniq
          p(class='lead').
            We're two ordinary people from Melbourne, Australia, who were frustrated
            with the time we saw wasted because of poor internal organisation.
            Each activist and organising group we belonged to was reinventing the
            wheel. Great ideas, skills and organisational memory were lost
            each time an activist moved on.
          p(class='lead').
            We were sure there had to be a better way. We looked around for tools
            which could help, but couldn't find anything that suited our needs or
            the activist budget.
          p(class='lead').
            Taking on the DIY spirit of activism and social movements, we
            learnt new skills and made our own organising tool. It will keep
            your group well-organised, running smoothly and most importantly,
            effective.
          p(class='lead').
            We really hope you like it as much as we do.
          p(class='lead').
            Keep fighting!
