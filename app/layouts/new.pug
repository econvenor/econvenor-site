            We're always trying to improve, and here's what we've done recently,
            and what it means for you.

          p.lead What's changed and why?
          p.
            If you've used this service before May 2019, you'll know that we
            used to be called eConvenor. Our new name is Meetniq. We pronounce
            it <i>meet-nik</i>.
          p.
            We changed it because as we get more users in more parts of the
            world, we realised that not everyone knows what a 'convenor' is,
            so the name eConvenor was confusing. Also, we just liked the sound
            of the new one.

          p.
            Tasks can now be shared among several people in your group. You
            will simply need to add the names when you create a task, and
            choose one person to coordinate the task and mark it complete.

            You'll be able to add attachments to your minutes and agendas.
            You'll have up to 7MB in attachments on any minute or agenda. 
            It's not big, but the size limit
            is because some email services won't allow
            bigger emails (including the email and it's attachments).
