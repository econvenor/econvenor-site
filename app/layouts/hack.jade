          h2(class="red") Where and when
          p.
            The next eConvenor hack day is <span class="red">Saturday 
            13th, June 2015</span> in Melbourne, Australia.
          p.
            From 10:00am to 5:30pm we work on eConvenor at 8 Studley Street,
            Abbotsford. Thanks to <span class="red">Common Code</span> for
            making their space available for us to use.
          p.
            From 6:00pm we relax and dine at Loving Hut, 10/242 Victoria St,
            Richmond.

          h2(class="red") Accessibility
          p.
            The space has no front step, a slight ramp (15cms), a wide front
            doorway, and accessible toilets. Toilets have gendered signs, we
            treat them as genderless. The walkway on the street is narrow. There
            is parking out the front (no ramp), and public transport nearby.
          p.
            Loving Hut in Richmond has a 15cm-20cm front step, standard-width
            door and average space between tables. Toilet doors are very narrow.

          h2(class="red") What to bring
          p.
            All you need to bring is your computer. Having a
            <a href="https://github.com" target="_blank">Github account</a>
            would also be handy.
          p.
            We'll supply lunch and snacks throughout the day. It will help us
            cater if you <a href="mailto:mail@econvenor.org?subject=RSVP+for+hack+day">
            let us know you're coming</a>.

          h2(class="red") Code of conduct
          p.
            We are committed to ending oppression, and a tiny part of that is
            making our space safer for all.
          p.
            Please read our <a href="conduct">code of conduct</a>.
            Everyone is expected to abide by it.
