                  NationBuilder's focus is external, eConvenor's focus is
                  internal.
                p.
                  NationBuilder is all about your group's relationships with
                  people outside the core of your group &mdash; your supporters
                  and donors.
                p.
                  eConvenor's focus is getting your group better organised
                  internally, with a focus on making meetings productive and
                  making sure people in the group do the tasks they are
                  responsible for.
                p.
                  There's no significant overlapping functionality between
                  eConvenor and NationBuilder that we know of.

                  How is eConvenor different from tools like Basecamp, Asana
                  and PB Works?

              div(class="faq-body")
                p(class="lead").
                  eConvenor is built specifically for community and activist
                  groups.
                p.
                  eConvenor has things in common with online project management
                  tools, but there are important differences:
                p.
                  strongeConvenor has a focus on meetings./strong It's built to
                  make meetings productive and capture meeting outcomes
                  (i.e. tasks and decisions) by producing very clear,
                  informative agendas and minutes. We're yet to find another
                  web service which does this. Well organised and documented
                  meetings are vitally important for effective activist groups.
                p.
                  <strong>Convenor is built for loose-knit groups.</strong> 
                  Whereas all group members need to have their own account on
                  other services and log in to it regularly, with eConvenor
                  only the group's convenors have an account. eConvenor
                  "pushes" information like agendas, minutes and tasks out
                  to the group via email, so group members don't need to manage
                  yet another web account.
                p.
                  <strong>eConvenor is built by activists specifically for
                  activist groups.</strong> Other services, although free
                  (or often "freemium"), are driven by a profit motive and
                  they're not tailored to activists.

            li
              div(class="faq-title")
                i(class="fa fa-li fa-plus-circle fa-lg red")
                p(class="lead") How does eConvenor make money?

              div(class="faq-body")
                p(class="lead") eConvenor isn't supposed to make money.
                p.
                  eConvenor is a tool made by activists to help other activists.
                  We work on and run eConvenor for free. Money is not our
                  motivation. eConvenor won't carry advertising, won't sell
                  your data and won't charge a fee for "premium" features.
                p.
                  Like everything though, eConvenor has some operating costs,
                  so we ask better funded groups to contribute financially if
                  they can, and we require a financial contribution from
                  political parties and trade unions.
                p.
                  Most groups who use eConvenor will have a tiny budget, or no
                  budget at all. These are the groups we had in mind when we
                  built it, and they can use eConvenor for free and with no
                  obligations.
                p.
                  eConvenor will never make a profit. All money which we receive
                  for eConvenor will go back into running and improving eConvenor.

                i(class="fa fa-li fa-plus-circle fa-lg red")
                p(class="lead") Who is behind eConvenor?

              div(class="faq-body")
                p(class="lead") Two Australian activists.
                p.
                  eConvenor was started by two activists from Melbourne,
                  Australia &mdash; Keira and Sky.
                p.
                  For a few decades we've seen how campaigns and groups struggle
                  to organise themselves and get things done efficiently.
                p.
                  One day we realised that a lot of the work of convening a
                  group could be done by a computer, so although we don't have
                  IT backgrounds, we decided to try and make a "virtual
                  convenor". eConvenor is the result and the service launched
                  in April 2014.

          h2(class="red") Security
          ul(class="fa-ul")
            li
              div(class="faq-title")
                i(class="fa fa-li fa-plus-circle fa-lg red")
                p(class="lead") Is eConvenor secure?

              div(class="faq-body")
                p(class="lead").
                  It's as secure as we can make it, but all security is relative.
                p.
                  There's no such thing as perfect computer security &mdash;
                  data is routinely stolen even from well-resourced targets
                  like governments and transnational corporations. We do our
                  best to keep eConvenor secure, but we can't give any guarantees.
                p.
                  Broadly speaking, there are three types of security to
                  consider with regard to data held in a web service &mdash;
                  security against theft, security against government demand and
                  security against accidental loss.
                p.
                  <strong>Theft:</strong> eConvenor is built on Django. Django is a
                  mature, open-source web-application framework which has had
                  plenty of time to get the underlying security right. eConvenor
                  is hosted by Webfaction in the Netherlands. Webfaction are a
                  Platform as a Service (PaaS) provider who make sure that the
                  server which eConvenor runs on is up-to-date and well
                  maintained. eConvenor shouldn't be an easy target for data
                  theft.
                p.
                  <strong>Government demand:</strong> eConvenor is based in
                  Australia and runs on a server in the Netherlands. We will
                  only hand data over to a government agency if we are forced
                  to by a valid court order, and even then we'll fight against
                  any demand vigourously. Note though that goverment agencies
                  have used sophisticated technical means to secretly collect
                  data from even the largest web service providers (Gmail,
                  Facebook, etc) and eConvenor's code and servers might be
                  vulerable to such attacks.
                p.
                  <strong>Accidental loss:</strong> We keep multiple backups of
                  your data on our Netherlands server, and multiple backups of
                  your data on our machines in Australia. The possibility of
                  accidental loss of data is remote. Also, eConvernor emails
                  you all your agendas and minutes, so you also have your own
                  copies of much of the data which eConvenor stores for you.

            li
              div(class="faq-title")
                i(class="fa fa-li fa-plus-circle fa-lg red")
                p(class="lead") Can I trust sensitive data to eConvenor?

              div(class="faq-body")
                p(class="lead") Yes, but be sensible.
                p.
                  eConvenor's Terms and Conditions require us to protect your
                  data and keep it confidential. They form a contract with you
                  which we are bound by, and we take our responsibilities under
                  it very seriously. We handle the data stored in eConvenor with
                  stricter confidentiality than for-profit services like Google
                  Drive or Dropbox.
                p.
                  Remember though, that if your data is very sensitive, you
                  should not be trusting it to any online service. Very
                  sensitive data should be carefully encrypted and stored on
                  computers and storage media which you own and can keep
                  physically secure.

            li
              div(class="faq-title")
                i(class="fa fa-li fa-plus-circle fa-lg red")
                p(class="lead") Will eConvenor sell or share any of my data?

              div(class="faq-body")
                p(class="lead") No.
                p.
                  We will not voluntarily give/transfer/sell/whatever your data
                  to anyone for any reason.
                p.
                  If we are pressured to hand over data by a government agency,
                  we will resist vigorously, but if we are faced with a valid
                  court order, we will comply with it.

            li
              div(class="faq-title")
                i(class="fa fa-li fa-plus-circle fa-lg red")
                p(class="lead").
                  How can I know eConvenor wasn't set up to spy on activists?

              div(class="faq-body")
                p(class="lead") Sadly, you can't.
                p.
                  We don't like it, but we have to say it: setting up a service
                  like eConvenor would be a good way for an intelligence service
                  (or services) to spy on activist groups.
                p.
                  Although we know we're not spies, cops, or anthing of that
                  nature, there's nothing we can do or say that can prove that
                  to you. That said, you can't know whether any web service
                  might be spying on you. Keep in mind also that we know that
                  services like Google and Facebook &mdash; which many groups
                  use to organise themselves &mdash; are spying on their users.
                p.
                  With all data your group puts online, whether with eConvenor
                  or any other web service, ask yourself if it would be a
                  problem if government agencies saw it. For most groups, the
                  answer to that question will be "no" most of the time. When
                  the answer is "yes" though, keep that data off the internet
                  unless you really know your way around encryption tools.

              div(class="faq-body")
                p(class="lead") Yes.
                p.
                  If your group wants the security of running eConvenor on
                  hardware which you control access to, we understand.
                p.
                  All of eConvenor's code is available in our
                  <a href="https://github.com/econvenor/econvenor" target="_blank">
                  Github repository</a>. If your group has a progresive focus,
                  is not-for-profit and is not a government agency, feel free to
                  run an eConvenor instance on your own server.
                p.

                p.
                  We'd love it if you'd Tweet or Facebook a recommendation about
                  eConvenor to the activists you know.
                p.
                  One of our main challenges at the moment is getting word about
                  eConvenor to the people and groups who will benefit from using
                  it. If you can take a few minutes to help us with that we'd
                  really, really appreciate it!

              div(class="faq-body")
                p(class="lead").
                  We're desperate for switched-on, reliable, nice people to work
                  on eConvenor.
                p.
                  eConvenor has the potential to be a great tool for activists
                  around the world, and it needs a lot of work for it to realise
                  that potential. We welcome people to work on it with us.
                p.
                  eConvenor is a very rewarding project. It has clear goals,
                  high standards, is well organised and produces tangible
                  results. It's also coordinated by nice people who are good
                  to work with.
                p.
                  To work on eConvenor you must be sensible, focused, good at
                  cooperating with other people and have good politics.
                p.
                  We are looking specifically for people with skills in coding
                  (Python/Django), web development (HTML/CSS/JS), web
                  application security, graphic design and writing/communications.
                p.
                  There are also always miscellaneous tasks which need doing,
                  and the only pre-requisite for working on them is an ability
                  to take some initiative and solve problems.
                p.
                  You probably realise this already, but just to be clear: 
                  eConvenor does not offer paid positions. It's a volunteer-run project.
