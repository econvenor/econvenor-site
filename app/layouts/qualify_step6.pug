  p(class="lead").
    Is your group a political party or trade union in a 
    high-income, reasonably democratic country?

  p.
    If it is, you must pay a fee to use eConvenor. This will help us provide 
    the service to less well-funded groups for free. Click the "Yes" button 
    below.


  p(class="lead").
    A note for unions and political parties in lower-income 
    and less democratic countries

  p.
    We understand that you won't have access to as many resources as similar 
    organisations in high-income and/or more democratic countries, so we'd 
    love you to to use eConvenor for free. Click the "No" button below to 
    continue.
