                <b>To run Meetniq and allow your group to use it</b>.
                For example, your name might be added by the account holder or coordinator 
                to meeting minutes or agendas, to
                note that you attended, did not attend, spoke, facilitated, 
                took minutes, were assigned a task, completed or updated a 
                task, or contributed in other ways.
              li.
                <b>To improve and maintain Meetniq.</b>
                For example, we might use information about how many overdue
                tasks there are to make improvements to our reminders.
              li.
                <b>To fix problems or make improvements you request.</b>

                the information you include in that form, along with your IP
                address and browser information will be used by us to

              li.
                <b>To promote Meetniq.</b>
                For example, we might publish a graph about how many tasks are
                assigned in Meetniq, or show how many organisations within a
                given movement use Meetniq. Any such use would NOT include 
                names, organisation names, or other identifying information,
