          h2(class='red') How we treat each other matters
          p.
            We welcome the contributions of people of all genders, cultures, 
            races, colours, ages, sizes, sexualities, classes, and abilities.
          p.
            We will work pro-actively to make involvement in the eConvenor 
            development community a welcoming, positive experience for everyone.
          p.
            To that end, there are some basic conditions of participation in 
            the eConvenor project:
          ul(class='fa-ul')
            li
              i(class='fa fa-li fa-arrow-circle-right fa-lg red')
              | Make an effort to be polite and friendly to other members of 
              | our community.
            li
              i(class='fa fa-li fa-arrow-circle-right fa-lg red')
              | Be aware that tech groups can be intimidating and unwelcoming 
              | for people who aren't straight 
              | <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisgender' target='_blank'>
              | cisgender</a> men, and go out of your way to make sure our 
              | community isn't like that.
            li
              i(class='fa fa-li fa-arrow-circle-right fa-lg red')
              | Treat other members of the community with patience and respect, 
              | regardless of their level of technical ability. Everyone was a 
              | beginner once.
            li
              i(class='fa fa-li fa-arrow-circle-right fa-lg red')
              | Don't raise your voice in frustration or anger. Remove yourself 
              | &mdash; take a break &mdash; if you can't control your reaction 
              | to a piece of work that's bothering you.
            li
              i(class='fa fa-li fa-arrow-circle-right fa-lg red')
              | Don't talk over anyone. If you must interrupt someone for some 
              | reason, that's okay, but do it politely and don't make a habit 
              | of it.
            li
              i(class='fa fa-li fa-arrow-circle-right fa-lg red')
              | Say something if you witness inappropriate conduct within our 
              | community. Either speak up at the time, or let Keira and Sky 
              | know so that they can deal with it.
            li
              i(class='fa fa-li fa-arrow-circle-right fa-lg red')
              | If someone asks you to change your behaviour, or points out a 
              | problem with it, take it on board. Listen first, then think, 
              | then respond &mdash; avoid reacting without thinking.
