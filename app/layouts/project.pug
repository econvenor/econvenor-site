          p.
            We provide the eConvenor service to help activist groups around the 
            world be better organised and more effective.
          h2(class="red") Background
          p The eConvenor project is a volunteer-run and not-for-profit.
          p.
            The core of the project are Keira and Sky &mdash; two activists from
            Melbourne, Australia &mdash; who were motivated to create eConvenor
            by decades of watching activist groups struggle to organise themselves
            and be effective.
          p The eConvenor service went live in April 2014.
          h2(class="red") Join in
          p eConvenor is an exciting project and it's off to a flying start.
          p.
